# Worst-Implementation
This is an assignment for a class- we are intentionally breaking all code conventions



-- RULES BROKEN --

- changed variables to nonsense names such as keyboard smash, complete lies, all caps, unknown abreviations, bee movie script, and cries for help (imsad)
- removed spaces between operators and after commas
- avoided whitespace whenever possible
- inconsistent cases for naming conventions
